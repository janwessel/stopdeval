%   Programmed on MATLAB 2012a, Psychtoolbox 3.0.6
%       Newer MATLAB should be supported, but check RNG reset command
%       [SD1initialize.m line 4]
%   I have explicitly tested this code under:
%       MAC OS X Mountain Lion running Matlab 2012a
%       Ubuntu 14.04. LTS running Matlab 2014b

%   When using this code, please cite the following two papers:
%       1. Wessel JR, O'Doherty JP, Berkebile M, Linderman D, Aron AR (2014).
%           Stimulus devaluation caused by stopping action.

%       2. Wessel JR, Tonnesen A, Aron AR (in prep).
%           Stimulus devaluation induced by action stopping is greater for explicit value representations
%   #1 introduces the experiment, #2 shares the code.
